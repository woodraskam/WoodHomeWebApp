# SPA Authentication Architecture - Implementation Checklist

## Overview
Implementation checklist for SPA Authentication Architecture refactor, following the comprehensive design outlined in SPA-Authentication-Architecture-ImplementationGuide.md.

## Current State Analysis
- **Existing Problem**: All services (Sonos, Hue, Calendar) initialize immediately on page load
- **Security Issue**: Unauthorized API calls and resource exposure

- [x] Test performance under load
- [x] Verify security measures

## Implementation Details

### Key Files to Create/Modify
- [x] `static/js/authentication-manager.js` (new)
- [x] `static/js/authenticated-section.js` (new)
- [x] `static/js/unauth-welcome.js` (new)
- [x] `static/js/sections/sonos.js` (modify)
- [x] `static/js/sections/hue.js` (modify)
- [x] `static/js/sections/calendar.js` (modify)
- [x] `static/js/sections/home.js` (modify)
- [x] `templates/spa-dashboard.html` (modify)
- [x] `static/css/spa-dashboard.css` (modify)

### Authentication Flow Implementation
- [x] User visits application
- [x] AuthenticationManager checks authentication state
- [x] If unauthenticated: Show welcome screen
- [x] If authenticated: Initialize required services
- [x] Services register with AuthenticationManager
- [x] Services activate based on authentication state

### Service Lifecycle Implementation
- [x] Service class defines authentication requirements
- [x] Service registers with AuthenticationManager
- [x] AuthenticationManager tracks service state
- [x] On authentication: Activate required services
- [x] On logout: Deactivate and cleanup services
- [x] Services persist state as needed

### Event System Implementation
- [x] `authentication:changed` - Authentication state changed
- [x] `service:register` - Service registered
- [x] `service:activate` - Service activated
- [x] `service:deactivate` - Service deactivated
- [x] `service:error` - Service error occurred

## Completion Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [x] Services only initialize when user is authenticated
- [x] Unauthenticated users see appropriate welcome screen
- [x] Authentication state persists across page reloads
- [x] Services clean up properly on logout
- [x] No unauthorized API calls
- [x] Proper service lifecycle management

### Technical Requirements
