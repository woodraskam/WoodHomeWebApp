## Completion Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Unified view showing both speakers and groups
- [ ] Group coordinators prominently displayed
- [ ] Member devices indented under coordinators
- [ ] Drag-and-drop group management
- [ ] Real-time updates via WebSocket
- [ ] Mobile-friendly touch interface

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Smooth drag-and-drop animations (60fps)
- [ ] Fast API response times (< 500ms)
- [ ] Efficient WebSocket message handling
- [ ] Responsive UI on all devices
- [ ] Proper error handling and user feedback

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Intuitive group management
- [ ] Clear visual hierarchy
- [ ] Consistent behavior across devices
- [ ] Touch-friendly mobile interface
- [ ] Accessible keyboard navigation

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Requirements
- **HTML5 Drag-and-Drop API**: Native browser support for drag-and-drop
- **Touch Events**: Mobile-friendly touch interactions
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox**: Responsive layout for unified view
- **JavaScript ES6+**: Modern JavaScript features for better code organization

### Backend Requirements
- **RESTful API**: Clean API design for group operations
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time updates for group changes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Transaction Support**: Atomic operations for group changes

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: API calls should complete within 500ms
- **Smooth Animations**: 60fps drag-and-drop animations
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient DOM management for large device lists
- **Network Efficiency**: Optimized WebSocket message handling

## Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Unified View**: Single list showing both individual speakers and groups
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Coordinators highlighted, members indented
3. **Drag-and-Drop**: HTML5 native API with touch support
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live changes
5. **Mobile First**: Touch-friendly interface for all devices

### Technical Considerations
- **RINCON Group Names**: Hidden from UI, managed in background
- **Group State**: Maintained through WebSocket updates
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- **Performance**: Optimized for large device lists and smooth animations

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end functionality testing
