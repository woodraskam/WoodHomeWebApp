└── assets/
    └── emojis/                 # Emoji card sets
```

**Dependencies**: No external dependencies required - uses existing MD3 framework

### 1.2 Data Models Implementation
**Deliverable**: Core data structures for game state

**Game State Model**:
```javascript
class MemoryGameState {
    constructor() {
        this.gridSize = 4; // 4x4 to 8x8
        this.cards = []; // 2D array of card objects
        this.players = []; // Array of player objects
        this.currentPlayer = 0;
        this.gamePhase = 'setup'; // 'setup', 'playing', 'finished'
        this.matchedPairs = 0;
        this.totalPairs = 0;
        this.flippedCards = []; // Currently revealed cards
        this.moves = 0;
        this.timer = 0;
    }
}

class Card {
    constructor(emoji, id, row, col) {
        this.emoji = emoji;
        this.id = id;
        this.row = row;
        this.col = col;
        this.isFlipped = false;
        this.isMatched = false;
        this.pairId = null; // Links paired cards
    }
}

class Player {
    constructor(name, color, isAI = false) {
        this.name = name;
        this.color = color;
        this.score = 0;
        this.matches = 0;
        this.isAI = isAI;
        this.isActive = true;
    }
}
```

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Game Initialization**: User selects grid size and player count
2. **Card Generation**: System creates emoji pairs and shuffles grid
3. **Gameplay Loop**: Players flip cards, system validates matches
4. **Turn Management**: System tracks current player and switches turns
5. **Game Completion**: System calculates scores and displays results

### Service Dependencies
- **GameStateManager**: Manages overall game state
- **CardManager**: Handles card operations and matching
- **PlayerManager**: Manages player turns and scoring
- **AnimationManager**: Handles card flip animations
- **AIManager**: Controls AI player behavior

### UI Components
- **GameContainer**: Main game wrapper
- **GridContainer**: Responsive card grid
- **CardComponent**: Individual card with flip animation
- **PlayerPanel**: Current player and score display
- **SettingsPanel**: Game configuration options
- **VictoryModal**: Game completion screen

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Support for 4x4, 6x6, and 8x8 grid configurations
- 1-4 player support with turn-based gameplay
- Emoji-based card system with unique pairs

- **AI Difficulty Scaling**: Balancing AI challenge across grid sizes

### Dependencies
- **Browser Emoji Support**: Requires modern browser emoji rendering
- **Touch Device Compatibility**: Mobile touch event handling
- **Memory Management**: Large grid state management
