# Connect Four - Complete Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

Connect Four is a classic two-player strategy game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid, aiming to be the first to connect four of their discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). This implementation will be integrated into the WoodHome WebApp as a web-based game accessible at the `/ConnectFour` route, following the same architectural pattern as the existing Tic Tac Toe and Candyland games.

## Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Days 9-10)

### 4.1 Server Integration
**Deliverable**: Connect Four route integration
- Add `/ConnectFour` route to server.go
- Template rendering setup
- Static file serving configuration
- Error handling and logging

### 4.2 Testing & Validation
**Deliverable**: Complete testing suite
- Game logic validation
- AI difficulty testing
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Performance optimization

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. User clicks on column to drop disc
2. Game validates move and updates board state
3. Win condition check after each move
4. AI calculates next move (if applicable)
5. UI updates with animations and feedback

### Service Dependencies
- **Game Engine**: Core Connect Four logic and rules
- **AI Service**: Minimax algorithm for computer opponent
- **Animation Service**: Visual effects and transitions
- **State Management**: Game state persistence and history

### UI Components
- **Game Board**: 7x6 grid with clickable columns
- **Disc Display**: Animated falling discs
- **Control Panel**: Game controls and settings
- **Score Display**: Player statistics and game history

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Two-player Connect Four gameplay
- AI opponent with multiple difficulty levels
- Win detection in all directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Smooth animations and visual feedback
- Game history and replay functionality

### Technical Requirements
- Fast AI response times (< 1 second)
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Mobile touch optimization
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Local storage for game persistence
- Clean, maintainable code structure

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **AI Performance**: Minimax algorithm complexity may cause delays
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Touch interface optimization challenges
- **Animation Performance**: Complex animations may impact performance

### Dependencies
- **Browser Compatibility**: Modern JavaScript features required
- **Mobile Devices**: Touch event handling complexity
- **Performance**: AI calculations on lower-end devices

## Timeline Summary
