- Performance benchmarking

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. User clicks on calendar day cell
2. Modal opens with events for that date
3. User selects event or clicks "Add Event"
4. Event details form loads in right pane
5. User edits event details and saves
6. API call updates Google Calendar
7. Calendar grid refreshes with updated events
8. Modal closes and returns to calendar view

### Service Dependencies
- **Google Calendar API**: Primary data source and sync
- **OAuth2 Service**: Authentication and token management
- **Cache Service**: Event caching for performance
- **Logging Service**: Error tracking and debugging

### UI Components
- **Calendar Grid**: Day cell click handlers
- **Event Modal**: Split-pane layout with event management
- **Event List**: Left pane with event selection
- **Event Form**: Right pane with event editing
- **Action Buttons**: Save, delete, cancel operations

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Click any calendar day to open event management modal
- View all events for selected date in left pane
- Select event to view/edit details in right pane
- Add new events with full Google Calendar integration
- Edit existing events with real-time updates
- Delete events with confirmation dialog
- Save changes back to Google Calendar
- Close modal by clicking outside or escape key

### Technical Requirements
- All operations sync with Google Calendar API
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Performance optimization for large event lists
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Google Calendar API Rate Limits**: Implement proper rate limiting and retry logic
- **OAuth2 Token Management**: Ensure secure token handling and refresh
- **Large Event Lists**: Implement pagination and virtual scrolling
- **Concurrent Edits**: Handle conflicts when multiple users edit same event

### Dependencies
- **Google Calendar API**: Requires active Google account and API access
- **OAuth2 Configuration**: Proper client ID and secret setup
- **Network Connectivity**: Reliable internet connection for API calls
- **Browser Compatibility**: Modern browser with JavaScript support
