## Overview
This Project will be to add a TicTacToe html/js game to an existing web page infrastructure. This system already has a game (Candyland) in the system, and part of the implementation plan to Analyze the structure/style of this game and create an additional implmentation guide for structurings a new /TicTacToe game like the existing /Candyland game.


Then the additional implementation steps can build off of that starting structure and web route /TicTacToe.

This game should be disnged to be optimized for mobile but a nice experience on desktop browser as well.
