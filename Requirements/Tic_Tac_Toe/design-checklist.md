# Design Implementation Checklist

**Requirement**: Tic Tac Toe
**Type**: Project
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Active

## Design Phase Status: âœ… Completed

### Architecture & Design
- [x] **System architecture defined** - Overall system design and structure
- [x] **Technology stack selected** - Technologies and frameworks to be used
- [x] **Database schema designed** - Data structure and relationships
- [x] **API interfaces specified** - External and internal API definitions

### Requirements Gathering
- [ ] **User stories written** - User-focused requirement descriptions
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria defined** - Clear, measurable success criteria
- [ ] **Edge cases identified** - Unusual scenarios and error conditions
- [ ] **Performance requirements** - Speed, scalability, and resource constraints

### Child Requirements
- [ ] **Tic Tac Toe - Requirements Framework** - This Project will be to add a TicTacToe html/js game to an existing web page infrastructure. This system already has a game (Candyland) in the system, and part of the implementation plan to Analyze the structure/style of this game and create an additional implmentation guide for structurings a new /TicTacToe game like the existing /Candyland game.


Then the additional implementation steps can build off of that starting structure and web route /TicTacToe.

This game should be disnged to be optimized for mobile but a nice experience on desktop browser as well.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Complete design phase checklist items
- [ ] Review and validate requirements
- [ ] Begin implementation planning
