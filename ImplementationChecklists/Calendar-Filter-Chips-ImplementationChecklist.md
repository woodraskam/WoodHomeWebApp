#### 3.2 Event Filtering Logic
- [x] Update event loading to include calendar filter parameter
- [x] Implement client-side event filtering as fallback
- [x] Add filter state management
- [x] Handle edge cases (no calendars selected, all calendars selected)
- [x] Add real-time event filtering without page reload

#### 3.3 Integration Testing
- [x] Test chip rendering with different numbers of calendars
- [x] Test filter functionality with various calendar combinations
- [x] Test responsive design on mobile devices

- [ ] Add quick filter presets (Work, Personal, All)
- [ ] Implement calendar search within filter chips
- [ ] Add calendar grouping by type (primary, shared, etc.)
- [ ] Implement filter state persistence across sessions
- [ ] Add localStorage for filter persistence

#### 4.2 Visual Feedback and States
- [ ] Add loading states for calendar data
- [ ] Implement empty state when no calendars available
- [ ] Add error states for failed calendar loads
- [ ] Add success feedback for filter changes
- [ ] Handle network connectivity issues

#### 4.3 Performance Optimization
